PART II: React Application

DONE 1. Create a react app

3. Create 3 routes with react-router-dom (https://reacttraining.com/react-
router/web/api/Route)
a. / -&gt; Returns all the pokemon names in a list and includes a link to the
detailed view
b. /pokemon/:id -&gt; Detailed view with the name, type and base
c. /pokemon/:id/:info -&gt; Super detailed view with only the names or the types
and or the bases
